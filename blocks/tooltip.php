    (2233 - 2293/2371), played by William Shatner, is the leading character in the
    original Star Trek TV series and the films based on it. Captain Kirk commanded
    the starship <span class="ship">Enterprise</span>
    (<a class="federation" title="Read more about the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) at Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_%28NCC-1701%29">NCC-1701</a>
    and later

  <p>Kirk's adventures and tactics are legendary in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants
    and continue to be cited well into the 24th century. He had a relaxed and
    confident style of command, but didn't suffer fools gladly. As Captain Benjamin
    Sisko said later about the iconic commander, he had "quite the reputation as a
    ladies' man". Kirk's record with Starfleet's Department of Temporal
    Investigations was unrivaled, with seventeen infractions. He ordered the
    <span class="ship">Enterprise</span> into multiple blatant violations of the
    Prime Directive.</p>
